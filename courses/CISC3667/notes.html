      <article>
        <p>Game design is the process of designing the content and rules of a game in the pre-production stage and
          involves concepts such as gameplay, environment, storyline, and characters. Game design requires artistic
          vision, technical knowledge, and an understanding of how players will interact with the game. A game designer
          creates <b>the core mechanics of a game, including its rules, objectives, challenges, and rewards</b>. They
          also
          design the user interface and overall user experience to ensure that players can easily navigate and enjoy the
          game.</p>

      <header><b>The Game Design Process</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>Design is a way to ask questions. Design research, when it occurs through the practice of
          design itself, is a way to ask larger questions beyond the limited scope of a particular
          design problem. When design research is integrated into the design process, new and
          unexpected questions emerge directly from the act of design.</p>

        <p>One such research design methodology: <b>the iterative design process</b>, is a design methodology based on
          <b>a cyclic process of prototyping, testing,
            analyzing, and refining a work in progress</b>.
        </p>

        <p>In iterative design, interaction with the
          designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as
          successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.</p>

        <p>Because the experience of a viewer/user/player/etc
          cannot ever be completely predicted, in an iterative process design <b>decisions are based on
            the experience of the prototype in progress</b>. The prototype is tested, revisions are made,
          and the project is tested once more. In this way, the project develops through an ongoing
          dialogue between the designers, the design, and the testing audience.</p>

        <p>In the case of games, iterative design means <b>playtesting</b>.</p>

        <p>Throughout the entire process of
          design and development, your game is played. You play it. The rest of the development
          team plays it. Other people in the office play it. People visiting your office play it. You
          organize groups of testers that match your target audience. You have as many people as
          possible play the game. In each case, you observe them, ask them questions, then adjust
          your design and playtest again.</p>

          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="center" >

         

        <p>This iterative process of design is radically different than typical retail game
          development. More often than not, at the start of the design process for a computer or
          console title, a game designer will think up a finished concept and then write an
          exhaustive design document that outlines every possible aspect of the game in minute
          detail. Invariably, the final game never resembles the carefully conceived original. <b>A
            more iterative design process, on the other hand, will not only streamline development
            resources, but will also result in a more robust and successful final product</b>.</p>

        <p>Game development is the process of creating a game from concept to final product. It involves a
          multidisciplinary approach that includes game design, programming, art and animation, sound design, and
          testing. <b>Game development typically involves several stages, including pre-production, production, and
            post-production</b>. During pre-production, the game concept is developed, and the game's mechanics and
          features
          are defined. In the production stage, the game is built, and assets such as graphics, sound effects, and music
          are created. Finally, in post-production, the game is tested for bugs and glitches, and any necessary changes
          are made before the game is released to the public.</p>

      <header><b>Game Engines</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>In this course, we will be creating both traditional games like board games and card games.
          For these types of games, we will simply be using
          pen, paper, and any other physical materials we may need.</p>

        <p>However, for video games, we will need to use a game engine. A game engine is a software framework designed
          for the creation and development
          of video games. It provides developers with a set of tools and features that simplify the game development
          process, allowing them to focus on creating the game's content rather than building everything from scratch.
          Game
          engines typically include features such as graphics rendering, physics simulation, audio processing, input
          handling,
          and scripting capabilities. Some popular game engines include Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and CryEngine.
          These
          engines are used by both indie developers and large game studios to create games for various platforms,
          including PC,
          consoles, and mobile devices.</p>

        <p>Unity is a powerful and widely used game engine that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for
          game development. It supports 2D and 3D game development, as well as virtual reality (VR) and augmented
          reality (AR) experiences. Unity offers a user-friendly interface, a robust asset store, and a large community
          of
          developers, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced game developers.</p>

        <p>We will be using the free version of Unity, which provides access to most of the engine's features and is
          suitable for small to medium-sized projects. You can download Unity for free from the official website: <a
            href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">https://unity.com/</a>. Make sure to check the system requirements
          to ensure that your computer meets the necessary specifications to run Unity smoothly.</p>

      <header><b>Game Development Tools</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>Game development tools are software applications and frameworks that assist developers in creating,
          designing,
          and managing various aspects of game development. These tools can range from game engines to asset creation
          software, version control systems, and project management tools. Here are some common types of game
          development
          tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Game Engines:</b> As mentioned earlier, game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot provide a
            comprehensive
            set of tools for building and deploying games across multiple platforms.</li>
          <li><b>Asset Creation Software:</b> Tools like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max are used for creating 3D models,
            animations, and textures. For 2D art, software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator,
            and GIMP are commonly used.</li>
          <li><b>Audio Tools:</b> Software like Audacity, FL Studio,
            and Ableton Live are used for creating and editing sound effects and music for games.</li>
          <li><b>Version Control Systems:</b> Tools like Git, SVN, and Perforce help developers manage changes to their
            codebase and collaborate with team members.</li>
          <li><b>Project Management Tools:</b> Applications like Trello, Jira, and Asana help teams organize tasks,
            track progress, and manage deadlines.</li>
          <li><b>Testing and Debugging Tools:</b> Tools like Unity Test Framework, NUnit, and Visual Studio Debugger
            assist developers in identifying and fixing bugs in their games.</li>
          <li><b>Collaboration Tools:</b> Platforms like Slack, Discord, and Microsoft Teams facilitate communication
            and collaboration among team members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tools are essential for streamlining the game development process, improving productivity, and ensuring
          the successful completion of a game project.</p>

      <header><b>What is a Game?</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>So we know what game design and game development are, but what exactly is a game?</p>

        <p>Brainstorm: <b>Think of as many different games as you can. Write down the names of the games, and a few
            words
            about what each game is like. Try to think of games that are very different from each other. For example,
            you might
            include chess, tag, poker, and Minecraft. What do these games have in common? How are they different?</b>
        </p>

        <p>So how would you define a game? What makes something a game?</p>

        <p>Are there games that do not fit this definition? Are there non-games that do fit this definition?</p>

        <p>We can start with the following definition:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A game is something you play.</b></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But this definition is a bit too broad. For example, you can play with a toy, but a toy is not a game. More
          specifically, <b>a toy is an
            object that you can play with</b>.</p>

        <p>However, this is still quite broad. You might play with a roll of tape, while idly sitting at your desk, but
          does that make it a toy? Technically, yes, but probably not a very good one.
          In fact, <b>anything you play with could be classified as a toy</b>. Perhaps it is a good idea
          for us to start considering what makes for a good toy.</p>

        <p>"<b>Fun</b>" is one word that comes to mind in conjunction with good toys. In fact, you might say: <b>A good
            toy is an object that is fun to play with</b>.</p>

        <p>See how we have expanded our definition? Still, what do we mean when we say "fun"? Do we simply mean
          pleasure,
          or enjoyment? Pleasure is part of fun, but is fun simply pleasure? There are lots of
          experiences that are pleasurable, for example, eating a sandwich or lying in the sun,
          but it would seem strange to call those experiences "fun".</p>

        <p>Generally, things that are fun
          have a special sparkle, a special excitement to them. Generally, fun things involve
          surprises. So a definition for fun might be: <b>Fun is pleasure with surprises</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Surprise</b> is a crucial part of all entertainment—it is at the root
          of humor, strategy, and problem
          solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an
          experiment where participants
          received sprays of sugar water
          or plain water into their mouths,
          the participants who received
          random sprays considered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays
          according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered. In other experiments, brain
          scans revealed that even during unpleasant
          surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.</p>

        <p>What are some examples of surprises? Here are a few:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In a card game, you might be dealt a hand of cards that is much better than you expected.</li>
          <li>In a movie, you might be shocked by an unexpected plot twist.</li>
          <li>In a puzzle game, you might figure out a solution that you hadn't considered before.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When designing games, it is important to consider how to create
          surprises that will delight players. Surprises can come in many forms, such as unexpected challenges,
          plot twists, or hidden rewards. By incorporating surprises into the game design, developers can create a more
          engaging and enjoyable experience for players.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What will surprise players when they play my game?</li>
          <li>Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the
            artwork? The technology?</li>
          <li>Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?</li>
          <li>Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Fun</b> is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis.</p>

        <p>To maximize a game's fun, ask yourself
          these questions:</p>

          <li>What parts of my game are fun? Why?</li>
          <li>What parts need to be more fun?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, back to toys. We say that a toy is an object you play with, and a good toy is
          an object that is fun to play with. But what do we mean by <b>play</b>?</p>

        <p>We all know what play is when we see it, but it is hard to express. Many people
          have tried for a solid definition of what play means, and most of them seem to have
          failed in one way or another. Let's consider a few:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"<b>Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy.</b>" —Friedrich Schiller
          </li>
          <li>"<b>Play refers to those activities which are accompanied by a state of comparative
              pleasure, exhilaration, power, and the feeling of self-initiative.</b>" —J. Barnard Gilmore</li>
          <li>"<b>Play is free movement within a more rigid structure.</b>" —Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman</li>
          <li>"<b>Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake.</b>" —George Santayana</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These definitions are all interesting, but they all seem to fall short in some way. For
          example, the first definition seems to exclude a lot of play that is not particularly
          energetic, such as playing chess. The second definition seems to exclude play that is
          not particularly pleasurable, such as playing a difficult puzzle game. The third
          definition seems to exclude play that is not particularly structured, such as freeform
          role-playing. The fourth definition seems to exclude play that is not particularly
          spontaneous, such as playing a game with rules.</p>

        <p>So, what exactly is play?</p>

        <p>Play can be summarized in roughly three aspects:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Perform</b> → players are active participants</li>
          <li><b>Pretend</b> → Not reality. If games are reality, "they're no longer games -- they're life."</li>
          <li><b>Not work</b> → Entertainment. "But, in the end, if it isn't fun, it's not a game; it's training or
            therapy. Or, unfortunately, a waste of time and money."</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We've come up with some definitions for toys and fun and even made a good solid
          run at play. Let's try again to answer our original question: How should we define
          "game"?</p>

        <p>Let's look at four distinct definitions of a game:</p>

        <p>According to game designer <b>Kevin Maroney</b>, a game is: <b>A game is a form of play with goals and
            structure.</b></p>

        <p>We can break this definition down into its parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Play:</b> A game is a form of play. Play is an activity that is performed for its own sake, not for
            practical purposes. Play is often characterized by imagination, creativity, and spontaneity.</li>
          <li><b>Goals:</b> A game has goals. Goals give players something to strive for and provide a sense of purpose
            and
            direction such as score, or winning condition.
            <br />
            <p>A game's goal <b>does not have to produce winners and losers</b>. Cooperative games (such as the games in
              Sid Sackson's Beyond Competition) allow every player to win if the goals are reached, and in Earthball, a
              noncompetitive sport invented in the 1970s, play continues indefinitely until the game is won.</p>

            <p>Role-playing games (which stretch the definition of games in so many ways) usually have neither winners
              nor losers. An individual player can achieve his or her own goals without preventing other players from
              achieving theirs. Players' goals tend to be ad hoc (succeed in a particular mission for the Emperor) or
              long-term milestones in a career rather than ending points (become a high-ranking noble). A referee's
              goals are even more nebulous— presenting a credible challenge to the players, advancing a storyline,
              bringing a particular object into play—and usually revolve around creating an entertaining atmosphere for
              the players. A referee who views the success of the players as a personal failure and vice versa is not
              likely to get a lot of repeat play</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Structure:</b> A game has structure. Structure provides the framework within which players can
            engage in play and pursue their goals. Structure can include rules, mechanics, and systems that govern how
            the game is played -- e.g. a referee.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Game designer <b>Jane McGonigal</b>, believes that when you strip away the genre differences and the
          technological complexities, all
          games share four defining traits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>A goal:</b> A game is a challenge with a clear outcome. Players must work to achieve a specific
            objective, whether it's reaching the finish line, solving a puzzle, or defeating an opponent.</li>
          <li><b>Rules:</b> A game has rules that define how players can interact with the game world and each other.
            Rules create structure and provide a framework for gameplay.</li>
          <li><b>Feedback system:</b> A game provides feedback to players based on their actions. This feedback can
            come in the form of points, rewards, or penalties, and helps players understand how well they are doing in
            the game.</li>
          <li><b>Voluntary participation:</b> A game is something that players choose to engage in voluntarily. Players
            must be willing to participate and follow the rules of the game in order for it to be considered a game.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the words of the late, great philosopher, Bernard Suits: <b>"Playing a game is the voluntary attempt
            to overcome unnecessary obstacles"</b></p>

        <p>Game designer <b>Jesse Schell</b>, on the other hand, defines a game as: <b>a problem-solving activity,
            approached with a playful attitude</b> (what philosopher Bernard Suits calls a "lusory attitude" (from the
          Latin <i>ludus</i>, play))
        </p>

        <p>We can actually see this theory in the film <i>Mary Poppins</i> (1964), as the titular character is about the
          sing the song <a href="https://youtu.be/_L4qauTiCY4?si=7HCV9s54WOjjDnNK" target="_blank">"A Spoonful of
            Sugar"</a>. The children are given the task of cleaning up their room, which is a
          chore or job, however, Mary Poppins turns it into a game by adding a playful attitude and making it fun.</p>

        <p>And lastly, according to game designer <b>Chris Crawford</b>, a game is: <b>an interactive, goal-oriented
            activity, with active agents to play against, in which players
            (including active agents) can interfere with each other.</b></p>

        <p>Crawford's four main principles are as such:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is <b>interactive</b>. Movies and books are cited as
            examples of
            non-interactive entertainment.
          </li>
          <li>If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a <b>toy</b>. (Crawford notes that by his definition,
            (a) a toy can
            become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not
            games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a <b>challenge</b>.</li>
          <li>If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete", it is a <b>puzzle</b>; if there is one, it
            is a
            <b>conflict</b>.
          </li>
          <li>Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their
            performance, the conflict is a <b>competition</b>. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.)
            However, <b>if
              attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game</b>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Brainstorm: <b>What are some games you have played that you found particularly fun or engaging? What makes
            these games be considered games based on the definitions provided above?</b></p>

        <p>In what way do the definitions above inform design?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fundamentals - know what to include</li>
          <li>Expanded genres help guide design</li>
          <li>Designing game - purpose - entertainment, competition, etc?</li>
          <li>Constraints limit what the designer can do</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Brainstorm: <b>Choose an activity that is not typically considered a game (e.g. waiting for the bus).
            Now turn it into a game. How will you do that?</b></p>
