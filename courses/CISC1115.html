            <article>
               <p>
                  Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.
               </p>
               <p> To create an application using Java, you will need:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK), <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     A command-line interface (CLI) on your computer that allows you to create and delete files, run programs, and navigate through folders and files (<b>On a Mac, it's called Terminal, and on Windows, it's Command Prompt</b>) OR an integrated development environment (IDE) - a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application, such as <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html">NetBeans</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://drjava.sourceforge.net/">DrJava</a>, etc.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>You write the program in the Java programming language, then a compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run anywhere.
                  The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java API, and a complete development environment. The JVM parses and runs (interprets) the Java bytecode. The Java API consists of an extensive set of libraries including basic objects, networking and security functions; Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and web services. Taken together, the Java language and the Java software platform create a powerful, proven technology for enterprise software development.

            <header>Hello world</header>
            <article>
               To start programming in Java, we can write a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie! 😃
               <p>Let's explore how Java "Hello, World!" program works:</p>
               <code>// Our First Program 
                  public class HelloWorld {
                  <text style="margin-left: 40px">public static void main(String[] args) {</text>
                  <text style="margin-left: 80px">System.out.println("Hello, World!"); </text>
                  <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
                  }
               </code>
               <p><b>How does the "Hello, World!" program work?</b></p>
               <ol>
                  <li>In Java, any line starting with // is a <b>single-line</b> comment (We will learn more about multi-line comments in a bit). Comments are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent and functionality of the program. It is completely ignored by the Java compiler (an application that translates Java program to Java bytecode that computer can execute).</li>
                  <li>Every application begins with a class definition. In this particular program, HelloWorld is the name of the class and the name of the class should match the filename in Java.</li>
                  <li>
                     Next is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method, and it's mandatory in each of our executable Java programs. The signature of the main method in Java is: <br><br>
                     <text style="margin-left: 50px">public static void main(String[] args) { ... .. ... }</text>
                  </li>
                  <li>Lastly, we have a print statement. It prints the text Hello, World! to standard output (your screen). The text inside the quotation marks is called a String <i>literal</i> in Java. <b>Notice the print statement is inside the main function, which is inside the class definition.</b></li>
               </ol>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
               You may have seen variables before (Think back to high school algebra! Solving for X, etc.) 
               <br><br>
               In programming, a variable is a location in memory (storage area) that holds data. 
               <br><br>
               (For now just one value at a time ... we'll come back to this later)
               <br><br>
               To indicate the storage area, each variable is given a unique name. The names of variables, called <b>identifiers</b>, conform to the following rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Identifiers CANNOT be a keyword (ex. keywords like int, for, class, etc CANNOT be used as a variable name (or identifier)
                  as they are part of the Java programming language syntax 
               </li>
               <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive (ex. age, AGE, Age, etc. are all valid identifiers and can all exist within the same program, 
                  although NOT RECOMMENDED 😡)
               </li>
               <li>Identifiers can be made up of a sequence of letters and digits. 
                  However, <b>it must begin with a letter, '$' (dollar sign) or '_' (underscore).</b> 
                  (It is convention to start an identifier with a letter)
                  The first letter of an identifier CANNOT be a digit.
               </li>
               <li>Identifiers CANNOT contain whitespaces, nor symbols such as @, #, and so on.</li>
               <li>Examples of <b>VALID</b> ✔️ identifiers:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>player1</li>
                  <li>score</li>
                  <li>level</li>
                  <li>highScore</li>
               </ul>
               <li>Examples of <b>INVALID</b> ❌ identifiers:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>pl@yer</li>
                  <li>1score</li>
                  <li>class</li>
                  <li>highest Score</li>
               </ul>
            </ul>
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
               It is easy to declare a variable:
               <p>
                  First we idenitfy the necessary keyword for the variable datatype. For example, a whole number should be declared as an integer type 
                  known as int while a decimal number should be declared as a float or double.
                  <code>int score = 42;</code> 
                  This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables (we'll talk about this more later 😉).
               </p>
               <p>
                  In the previous example, we have assigned value to the variable during declaration -- this is known as initialization, because we assign an initial value to a variable. 
                  <br><br> However, we can also declare variables and assign variables separately. For example:
                  <br>
                  <code>int score;
                  score = 42;</code> 
               </p>
               <p>
                  The value of a variable can be modified throughout the program (that's what makes it a <i>variable</i>, opposed to a <i>literal</i>) For example:
                  <br>
                  <code>int score = 0;
                  ...
                  ...
                  ...
                  score = 42;</code> 
                  <br>
                  Here, initially, we set the score to 0. Later (after some more code -- not yet specified) we changed it to 42.
                  It is important to remember, however, that we CANNOT change the data type of a variable in Java within the same scope (we'll discuss scope a bit more later, for now just think of our scope limited to the main method)

                  Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, we know that + is an operator used for addition, while * is an operator used for multiplication.
               </p>
               <p>Operators in Java can be classified into the following types:</p>

                        <li>- (Subtraction, e.g. a - b)</li>
                        <li>* (Multiplication, e.g. a * b)</li>
                        <li>/ (Division, e.g. a / b)</li>
                        <li>% (Modulus -Remainder after division, e.g. a % b)</li>
                        <li>++ (Increment, e.g. a++ or ++a)</li>

            <article>
               <p>
                  Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                  pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                  variables using the window.variable syntax.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                  or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                  frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                  declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                  iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
               </p>

            <article>
               <p>
                  You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                  The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                  identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                  and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
               </p>
               <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
               <p>
                  A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                  while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                  scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                  assumed to represent a variable.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                  variable in the same scope. For example:
               </p>
               <code
                  >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
               WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
               //statements }</code
                  >
               However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
               statement is executed without problems.
               <code
                  >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
               "otherValue";</code

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
               <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                           null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                           JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                           NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                           Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                           are unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>and Object</li>
               </ul>
               Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
               you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
               functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
               think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
               procedures that your application can perform.

            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
               Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
               true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
               condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
               <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
               condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
               Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
               condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
               statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
               statement, including further nested if statements.
               <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
               </p>
               <code
                  >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
               statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
               statement_last; }
               </code>
               In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
               which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
               statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
               general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
               when nesting if statements:
               <code
                  >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
               statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
               statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
               statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
                  >
               It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
               expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
               glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
               <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
               an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
               additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
               <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
               A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
               condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
               <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
               false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
               the statement following the loop.
               <p>
                  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                  If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                  condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                  stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
               </p>
               <p>
                  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                  group those statements.
               </p>
               Example:
               <p>
                  The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
               </p>
               <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
               <p>
                  With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                  Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                  true, so the loop terminates.

            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <article>
               A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
               statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
               <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                     A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                     separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                     curly brackets, { }.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                  square:
               </p>
               <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
               <p>
                  The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                  consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                  function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                  statement specifies the value returned by the function.
               </p>
               <code>return number * number;</code>
               <p>
                  Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                  value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
                  changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                  globally or in the calling function.
