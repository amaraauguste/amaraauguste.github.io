      <header><b>Intro to Programming</b></header>
      <article>
      <p>
        In this class, we will write programs.
        <br /><br />
        But first, what is a program?
        <br /><br />
        A <b>program</b> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
        perform a computation. <br />

        Every program you’ve
        ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that
        look much like the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>input:</b> get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>output:</b> display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>math:</b> perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>decisions:</b> check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>repetition:</b> perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can think of <b>programming</b> as the process of:
        <i>breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks.</i>
        <br><br>
        The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with
        the basic instructions provided by the computer.
      </p>
      </article>
      <br />
      <header>What is Computer Science?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding <i><b>how</b></i> to
          solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions.
          <br /><br />

          In order to determine which way is best for a given situation,
          we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Computer science</b> is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and
          analysis.
          <br /><br />
          An <b>algorithm</b> is a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a
          problem.
        <ul>
          <li>Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space
            in computer memory.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone.
          <br><br>
          For historical reasons, programming errors are called <b>bugs</b>, and the process of tracking them down and
          correcting them is called <b>debugging</b>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <header>Programming Languages</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The programming language you will learn in this class is <b>Java</b>, which is a high-level language.
            <br> <br>
            A <b>high-level language</b> is any programming language that enables development of a program
            in a much more <b>user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware
              architecture.</b>
            <br><br>
            Other high-level languages you may have heard of include:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C and C++</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated
          into a <b>low-level language</b>, also called “machine language”.
          <br><br>
          This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            High-level languages have two advantages:
          <ol>
            <li>It is much <b>easier</b> to program in a high-level language.</li>
            <ul>
              <li> Programs take
                less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more
                likely to be correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>High-level languages are <b>portable</b>, meaning they can run on different
              kinds of computers with few or no modifications.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Low-level programs
                can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run
                on another.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages:
          <b>interpreters</b> and <b>compilers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>An <b>interpreter</b> reads a high-level program and
              executes it, meaning that it does what the program says.
              It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations</li>
            <br>
            <li>A <b>compiler</b> reads the entire program and translates it completely
              before the program starts running. In this context, the high-level program is called the <b>source
                code</b>, and the translated program is called the object
              code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it
              repeatedly without further translation. As a result, <b>compiled programs often
                run faster than interpreted programs.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <header><b>What is Java?</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
          language and software platform that runs on billions of devices,
          including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles,
          medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are
          based on the C and C++ languages.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some specific examples of real world applications that use Java: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn</li>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create an application using Java, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK),
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">which is available for Windows, macOS, and
              Linux</a>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A command-line interface (CLI) on your computer that allows you to
            create and delete files, run programs, and navigate through
            folders and files (<b>On a Mac, it's called Terminal, and on Windows, it's Command
              Prompt</b>) OR an integrated development environment (IDE) - a software
            application that helps programmers develop software code
            efficiently by combining capabilities such as software editing,
            building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application,
            such as
            <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>,
            <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html">NetBeans</a>,
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows">IntelliJ</a>, <a
              href="https://drjava.sourceforge.net/">DrJava</a>, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You write the program in the Java programming language, then a
          compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set
          for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java
          runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification
          on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run
          anywhere. The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java
          API, and a complete development environment. The JVM parses and runs
          (interprets) the Java bytecode.

          security functions; Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and
          web services. Taken together, the Java language and the Java
          software platform create a powerful, proven technology for
          enterprise software development.

      <header><b>Hello World</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          To start programming in Java, we can write a simple program that
          outputs "Hello, World!" on the screen. Since it's a very simple
          program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to
          a newbie! 😃
        </p>
        <p>Let's explore how Java "Hello, World!" program works:</p>
        <code><text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">// Our First Program</text>
            <text>public class HelloWorld {</text>
            <text style="margin-left: 40px"
              >public static void main(String[] args) {</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 80px"
              >System.out.println("Hello, World!");</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
            <text>}</text>
          </code>
        <br />
        <p><b>How does the "Hello, World!" program work?</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In Java, any line starting with // is a <b>single-line</b> comment
            (We will learn more about multi-line comments in a bit). Comments
            are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent
            and functionality of the program. It is completely ignored by the
            Java compiler (an application that translates Java program to Java
            bytecode that computer can execute).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Every application begins with a class definition. In this
            particular program, HelloWorld is the name of the class and the
            name of the class should match the filename in Java.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Next is the main method. Every application in Java must contain
            the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from
            the main method, and it's mandatory in each of our executable Java
            programs. The signature of the main method in Java is:
            <br /><br />
            <text style="margin-left: 50px">public static void main(String[] args) { ... .. ... }</text>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Lastly, we have a print statement. It prints the text Hello,
            World! to standard output (your screen). The text inside the
            quotation marks is called a String <i>literal</i> in Java.
            <b>Notice the print statement is inside the main function, which
              is inside the class definition.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <br />
      <header>Comments</header>
      <article>
        <p> Comments have no effect on
          the execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers
          (and yourself!) to understand what you meant to do and how the program works.</p>
        <p>There are three types of comments:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">

      <br />
      <header><b>Variables</b></header>
      <p>
        You may have seen variables before (Think back to high school algebra!
        Solving for X, etc.)
        <br /><br />
        In programming, a variable is a location in memory (storage area) that
        holds data.
        <br /><br />
        (For now just one value at a time ... we'll come back to this later)
        <br /><br />
        To indicate the storage area, each variable is given a unique name.
        The names of variables, called <b>identifiers</b>, conform to the
        following rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identifiers CANNOT be a keyword (ex. keywords like int, for, class,
          etc CANNOT be used as a variable name (or identifier) as they are
          part of the Java programming language syntax
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers are case-sensitive (ex. age, AGE, Age, etc. are all
          valid identifiers and can all exist within the same program,
          although NOT RECOMMENDED 😡)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers can be made up of a sequence of letters and digits.
          However,

      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <br />
      <article>
        It is easy to declare a variable!
        <br />
        <p>
          First we identify the necessary keyword for the variable datatype.
          For example, a whole number should be declared as an integer type
          known as int while a decimal number should be declared as a float or
          double.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> </code>
          <br />
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables
          (we'll talk about this more later 😉).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the previous example, we have assigned value to the variable
          during declaration -- this is known as initialization, because we
          assign an initial value to a variable.
          <br /><br />
          However, we can also declare variables and assign variables
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score;</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text>
          </code>
        <p>When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
          <br><br>
          When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of a variable can be modified throughout the program
          (that's what makes it a <i>variable</i>, opposed to a
          <i>literal</i>)
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score = 0;</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text></code>
        <p>Here, initially, we set the score to 0.</p>
        <p>
          Later (after some more code -- not yet specified) we changed it to
          42.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to remember, however, that we CANNOT change the data
          type of a variable in Java within the same scope (we'll discuss
          scope a bit more later, for now just think of our scope limited to
          the main method)
        </p>

      <header>Printing Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          We can display the value of a variable using print or println.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> 
              <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//What should be printed below?</text>
              <text>System.out.println(score);</text>
            </code>
          <br />
          When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean the <b>value</b> of the variable.
          <br><br>
          To display the name of a variable, you have to put it in quotes.

      <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <article>

                The scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
               </p>
               <p>
                In general, a set of curly brackets { } defines a scope. 
                <br><br>
                <b>A variable declared inside pair of brackets “{” and “}” in a method is only accessible within the scope of the brackets only.</b>
                (This will make more sense when we explore conditional statements, loops, methods, etc.)

                <b>These variables can be directly accessed anywhere in class.</b>

          Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and
          values. For example, we know that + is an operator used for
          addition, while * is an operator used for multiplication.

      <header><b>Floating-point Numbers</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Floating-point numbers in Java are used to represent fractional values or numbers with a large range of
          possible values.
          They are primarily used when precise decimal calculations are not required.
          <br><br>
          Java uses two primitive data types to represent floating-point numbers: <b>float</b> and <b>double</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>float</b> data type is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number</li>
          <li>The <b>double</b> data type (which we will use in this class rather than float) is a 64-bit
            double-precision floating-point number.
            This makes the double data type more accurate than the float data type.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p> We can create double variables and assign values to them using
          the same syntax we used for the other types:
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>double payRate = 42.5;</text> </code>
        </p>
        <p>The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer 
          is to use a <b>type cast</b>, so called because it molds or “casts” 
          a value from one type to another.</p>
          <p>
            The syntax for type casting is to put the name of the type 
            in parentheses and use it as an operator.</p>
          <code><text>double payRate = 42.5;</text> 
            <text>int pay = (int) payRate;</text></code>
          <p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>What is the value of the variable pay?</b></p>
        <header>Integer vs Floating Point Division</header>
        <p>In math, division often allows for remainders.
          It is why whenever a number is <b>NOT</b> evenly divisible by another number
          it can result in a decimal number opposed to a whole number
          e.g. 5/2 is equal to 2.5
          <br><br>
          However, <b>integer division</b> and division as we know from math class
          (also known as <b>floating-point division</b>) are two <b>different</b> ways of performing division
          operations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Integer division</b> is the division operation performed on two integers, resulting in an <b>integer
            quotient</b>.
          The result is obtained by discarding the fractional part of the division, if any.
          In other words, <b>it performs a "round towards zero" operation.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, if you perform an integer division of 10 divided by 3, the result is 3 because it discards
            the fractional part.</li>
          <li>Similarly, if you divide -10 by 3 using integer division, the result is -3, as it still rounds towards
            zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
        On the other hand, <b>floating-point division</b> is the division operation performed on floating-point numbers
        (those with decimal places).
        <b>It produces a result with decimal places</b>, including the fractional part.
        This type of division is typically <b>more accurate and provides more precise results</b>.
        </p>
        <p>In Java, when dividing two integers using the '/' operator,
          <b>integer division is performed if both operands are integers</b>.
          <br><br>
          To perform floating-point division, <b>at least one of the operands should be a floating-point number</b>.
          <br><br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <code><text>int result = 10 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Integer division, result is 3</text></text>
            <text>double result = 10.0 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Regular division, result is approximately 3.3333</text></code>
        </text>
        <p>It is important to be aware of the distinction between integer division and floating-point division,
          especially when working with different data types and when precision is required in calculations.</p>

        <p>
          Java has a lot of built-in Math methods that allow us to perform more complex mathematical computations.
          The Math class is found in the java.lang package, so you don’t have to import it.
          <br><br>
          For example, if you need to get the square root of a number, we use the Math.sqrt() method.
        </p>
        <p>Some frequently used Math class methods include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Math.abs</b>(n) - for computing the absolute value of a particular number</li>
          <li><b>Math.sqrt</b>(n) - for computing the square root of a particular number</li>
          <li><b>Math.pow</b>(base, exp) - for computing the result of a particular base raised to the power of a
            particular exponent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can learn more about the Java Math class methods from the Java API <a

      <header>Generating Random Numbers</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Most computer programs do the same thing every time they run, 
          meaning they are <b>deterministic</b>. Usually we want our
          programs to be deterministic since we expect the same 
          calculation to yield the same result. But for certain applications (e.g. games)
          we want to write programs that are <b>nondeterministic.</b>
          <br><br>
          It is hard for a computer to generate <i>truly</i> random numbers. But there are algorithms
          that generate unpredictable sequences called <b>pseudorandom</b> numbers. For
          most applications, <b>they are as good as random.</b>
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Math.random()</b> method returns a pseudorandom 
        double type number between 0.0 and 1.0, 
        where 0.0 is <b>inclusive</b> and 1.0 is <b>exclusive.</b></p>
        <p>When this method is first called, 
          it creates a single new pseudorandom-number generator</p>
          <code><text>public class RandomExample {</text>
          <text style="margin-left: 40px"
            >public static void main(String[] args) {</text
          >
          <text style="margin-left: 80px">double rand = Math.random();<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Generate random number</text></text>
          <text style="margin-left: 80px"
            >System.out.println("Random Number:" + rand);<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//different each run</text></text

          <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
          <text>}</text>
        </code>
        <p>to generate random number in range:</p>

      <header><b>Types of Errors</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are three types of errors can occur in a program:
        <ol>
          <li>Compiler errors</li>
          <li>Run-time errors</li>
          <li>Logic errors</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><b>Compiler errors</b> occur when you <b>violate the syntax rules</b> of the Java language.
          For example, forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement or
          that parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs.
          So (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is not.
          In the latter case, the program cannot be compiled, and the compiler displays an error.
        <ul>
          <li>Error messages from the compiler usually indicate where in the program the error occurred, and sometimes
            they can tell you exactly what the error is.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Run-time errors</b> occur while the interpreter is executing byte code
          and <b>something goes wrong</b>.
          These errors are also called “exceptions” because they usually
          indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
          (Example: attempting divide by zero)
        <ul>
          <li>When a run-time error occurs, the interpreter displays an
            error message that explains what happened and where.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The third type of error is the <b>logic error</b>.
          If your program has a logic error, it will compile and run
          without generating error messages, but <b>it will not do the right thing</b>.
          Instead, it will do exactly what you told it to do (even if it isn't the right solution).
        <ul>
          <li>Usually the compiler and the interpreter <b>CANNOT</b> help you,
            since they don’t know what the right thing is. </li>
        </ul>

  <header><b>The System class</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>
      So far we have used <b>System.out.println()</b> to display text to the
      screen. But what does it actually mean? <br /><br />
      <b>System</b> is a class (that belongs to the java.lang package,
       which is imported automatically) that provides methods related to the “system” or
      environment where programs run. 
    </p>
    <p>
      System.out represents the <b><i>Standard Output Stream</i></b
      >. That means that if we want to print any statement on the console, we
      should use the following statement: <br /><br />
      <text style="margin: 300px; font-size: 50px">System.out.print();</text>
    </p>
    <p>There are three methods we use to print statements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>print(String s)</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Used to print on the console.</li>
        <li>Accepts a string as a parameter (we can concatenate parts to 
          the string if necessary, i.e. “Hello” + “ World”, etc. 
          however, it is typical convention to include all string literals 
          in the same pair of quotations if they are consecutive) </li>
        <li>After printing the statement, <b>the cursor remains on the same line.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>println(String s)</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>An upgraded version of the print() method, 
          also used to display text on the console.</li>
        <li>After printing the statement, 
          it throws <b>the cursor at the start of the next line.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>printf(String format, datatype args)</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Accepts two parameters:</li>
            <ul>
              <li style="list-style-type: circle"><b>format</b>: It is a formatted String, uses placeholders 
                with specific conversion characters to refer to the 
                arguments that will be replaced when printing</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: circle">
                <b>args</b>: It is an argument referenced by the format specifiers. 
                If the number of arguments is more than the format specifiers, the other arguments are ignored. 
                The number of arguments may be zero.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>A formatted placeholder is declared as follows:</p>
        <text style="font-size: 48px">%[flags][width][.precision]conversion-character</text>

  <header><b>The Scanner Class</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>
      The System class also provides the special value <b>System.in</b>, which
      is an InputStream that provides methods for reading input from the
      keyboard. These methods are not easy to use; fortunately, Java provides
      other classes that make it easier to handle common input tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All reading done in Java uses the <b>Scanner</b> class. Using this class,
      we can create an object to read input from the standard input channel
      System.in (in our case, the keyboard)
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the Scanner class, it is necessary to import the class Scanner from
      the library java.util by including the following line at the top of
      program:
    </p>
    <text style="margin: 250px; font-size: 50px"
      >import java.util.Scanner;</text
    >
    <p>We can declare a Scanner object by saying:</p>
    <text style="margin: 80px; font-size: 50px"
      >Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);</text
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        sc is the <b>name of the Scanner object</b> (this can be changed and is
        entirely up to the person who writes the code)
      </li>
      <li>
        and System.in connects our object to <b>standard input</b> (the keyboard)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Scanner class has multiple built-in methods that we can access to help
      us read data, for example: we can use sc.nextLine() to read in a line of
      String(s) (spaces included)
    </p>
    <p>Other methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>nextBoolean()</b>: reads a boolean value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextByte()</b>: reads a byte value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextDouble()</b>: reads a double value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextFloat()</b>: reads a float value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextInt()</b>: reads a int value from the user</li>
      <li>
        <b>next()</b>: reads a complete token (String) from the user. A complete token
        is preceded and followed by input that matches the delimiter pattern, in
        most instances this is a space
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <br />
  <header>Reading from Files</header>
  <article>
    <p>
      As previously mentioned, we use a Scanner to read data whether or not the data is from the keyboard or a file. 
      <b>To read from a file we only need to make one or two modifications from what we learned from reading from the keyboard.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      First, since we are using files we need to allow our program(s) to use them by including:
    </p>
    <text style="margin: 100px; font-size: 45px"
      >import java.io.File; <text style="color: rgb(65, 180, 252)">//import the File class</text></text
    >
    <p>Now we can add a <b>throws Exception</b> declaration to main and create the File object that we will be reading from:</p>
    <text style="margin: 140px; font-size: 50px"
      >File file= new File("[filename].txt");</text
    >
    <p>And create a Scanner like we have previously done, only changing our reference from the keyboard to the corresponding file object:</p>
    <text style="margin: 165px; font-size: 50px"
      >Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);</text
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important that you remember to create the .txt file that you are trying to 
        reading from and make sure that it is in the correct directory or to specify the path 
        where the file is located when creating the File object else you will receive a <b>FileNotFoundException</b> 
        when you attempt to run your code.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <header><b>Writing to a File</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>
      We already know about writing data to the screen by using System.out, 
      but how about writing data to an outside source such as a file?
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing to a file is slightly less work since we do not have 
      to manually create the .txt file ourselves prior to running the program, 
      the program will do the creation for us. There are many different ways to 
      write to file in Java but in this class we will keep it relatively 
      simple and use the <b>PrintWriter</b> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like before, we need to import the PrintWriter class in order to use it:
    </p>
    <text style="margin: 150px; font-size: 50px"
      >import java.io.PrintWriter;</text
    >
    <p>We will use the PrintWriter class to create our file:</p>
    <text style="margin: 20px; font-size: 45px"
      >PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(“[filename]”.txt);</text
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important to make sure that the filename that you are trying to create
       <b>does not already exist</b> in the directory that you are trying to create it in 
        otherwise, you will overwrite the file and lose your original file data 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now we can use the PrintWriter object to write, the same way that we wrote
      to the screen only replacing System.out with our PrintWriter object, 
      i.e. pw.print(), pw.println(), pw.printf(), etc.
