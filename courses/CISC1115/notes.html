      <header><b>Intro to Programming</b></header>
      <p>
        In this class, we will write programs.
        <br /><br />
        But first, what is a program?
        <br /><br />
        A <b>program</b> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
        perform a computation. <br />

        Every program you’ve
        ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that
        look much like the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>input:</b> get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>output:</b> display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>math:</b> perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>decisions:</b> check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>repetition:</b> perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can think of <b>programming</b> as the process of:
        <i>breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks.</i>
        <br><br>
        The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with
        the basic instructions provided by the computer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <header>What is Computer Science?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding <i><b>how</b></i> to
          solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions.
          <br /><br />

          In order to determine which way is best for a given situation,
          we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Computer science</b> is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and
          analysis.
          <br /><br />
          An <b>algorithm</b> is a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a
          problem.
        <ul>
          <li>Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space
            in computer memory.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone.
          <br><br>
          For historical reasons, programming errors are called <b>bugs</b>, and the process of tracking them down and
          correcting them is called <b>debugging</b>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <header>Programming Languages</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The programming language you will learn in this class is <b>Java</b>, which is a high-level language.
            <br> <br>
            A <b>high-level language</b> is any programming language that enables development of a program
            in a much more <b>user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware
              architecture.</b>
            <br><br>
            Other high-level languages you may have heard of include:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C and C++</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated
          into a <b>low-level language</b>, also called “machine language”.
          <br><br>
          This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            High-level languages have two advantages:
          <ol>
            <li>It is much <b>easier</b> to program in a high-level language.</li>
            <ul>
              <li> Programs take
                less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more
                likely to be correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>High-level languages are <b>portable</b>, meaning they can run on different
              kinds of computers with few or no modifications.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Low-level programs
                can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run
                on another.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages:
          <b>interpreters</b> and <b>compilers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>An <b>interpreter</b> reads a high-level program and
              executes it, meaning that it does what the program says.
              It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations</li>
            <br>
            <li>A <b>compiler</b> reads the entire program and translates it completely
              before the program starts running. In this context, the high-level program is called the <b>source
                code</b>, and the translated program is called the object
              code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it
              repeatedly without further translation. As a result, <b>compiled programs often
                run faster than interpreted programs.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <header><b>What is Java?</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
          language and software platform that runs on billions of devices,
          including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles,
          medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are
          based on the C and C++ languages.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some specific examples of real world applications that use Java: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn</li>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create an application using Java, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK),
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">which is available for Windows, macOS, and
              Linux</a>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A command-line interface (CLI) on your computer that allows you to
            create and delete files, run programs, and navigate through
            folders and files (<b>On a Mac, it's called Terminal, and on Windows, it's Command
              Prompt</b>) OR an integrated development environment (IDE) - a software
            application that helps programmers develop software code
            efficiently by combining capabilities such as software editing,
            building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application,
            such as
            <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>,
            <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html">NetBeans</a>,
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows">IntelliJ</a>, <a
              href="https://drjava.sourceforge.net/">DrJava</a>, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You write the program in the Java programming language, then a
          compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set
          for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java
          runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification
          on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run
          anywhere. The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java
          API, and a complete development environment. The JVM parses and runs
          (interprets) the Java bytecode.

          security functions; Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and
          web services. Taken together, the Java language and the Java
          software platform create a powerful, proven technology for
          enterprise software development.

      <header><b>Hello World</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          To start programming in Java, we can write a simple program that
          outputs "Hello, World!" on the screen. Since it's a very simple
          program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to
          a newbie! 😃
        </p>
        <p>Let's explore how Java "Hello, World!" program works:</p>
        <code><text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">// Our First Program</text>
            <text>public class HelloWorld {</text>
            <text style="margin-left: 40px"
              >public static void main(String[] args) {</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 80px"
              >System.out.println("Hello, World!");</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
            <text>}</text>
          </code>
        <br />
        <p><b>How does the "Hello, World!" program work?</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In Java, any line starting with // is a <b>single-line</b> comment
            (We will learn more about multi-line comments in a bit). Comments
            are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent
            and functionality of the program. It is completely ignored by the
            Java compiler (an application that translates Java program to Java
            bytecode that computer can execute).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Every application begins with a class definition. In this
            particular program, HelloWorld is the name of the class and the
            name of the class should match the filename in Java.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Next is the main method. Every application in Java must contain
            the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from
            the main method, and it's mandatory in each of our executable Java
            programs. The signature of the main method in Java is:
            <br /><br />
            <text style="margin-left: 50px">public static void main(String[] args) { ... .. ... }</text>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Lastly, we have a print statement. It prints the text Hello,
            World! to standard output (your screen). The text inside the
            quotation marks is called a String <i>literal</i> in Java.
            <b>Notice the print statement is inside the main function, which
              is inside the class definition.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <br />
      <header>Comments</header>
      <article>
        <p> Comments have no effect on
          the execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers
          (and yourself!) to understand what you meant to do and how the program works.</p>
        <p>There are three types of comments:</p>

      <br />
      <header><b>Variables</b></header>
      <p>
        You may have seen variables before (Think back to high school algebra!
        Solving for X, etc.)
        <br /><br />
        In programming, a variable is a location in memory (storage area) that
        holds data.
        <br /><br />
        (For now just one value at a time ... we'll come back to this later)
        <br /><br />
        To indicate the storage area, each variable is given a unique name.
        The names of variables, called <b>identifiers</b>, conform to the
        following rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identifiers CANNOT be a keyword (ex. keywords like int, for, class,
          etc CANNOT be used as a variable name (or identifier) as they are
          part of the Java programming language syntax
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers are case-sensitive (ex. age, AGE, Age, etc. are all
          valid identifiers and can all exist within the same program,
          although NOT RECOMMENDED 😡)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers can be made up of a sequence of letters and digits.
          However,
          <b>it must begin with a letter, '$' (dollar sign) or '_'
            (underscore).</b>
          (It is convention to start an identifier with a letter) The first
          letter of an identifier CANNOT be a digit.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers CANNOT contain whitespaces, nor symbols such as @, #,
          and so on.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Examples of <b>VALID</b> ✔️ identifiers:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>player1</li>
          <li>score</li>

      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <br />
      <article>
        It is easy to declare a variable!
        <br />
        <p>
          First we identify the necessary keyword for the variable datatype.
          For example, a whole number should be declared as an integer type
          known as int while a decimal number should be declared as a float or
          double.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> </code>
          <br />
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables
          (we'll talk about this more later 😉).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the previous example, we have assigned value to the variable
          during declaration -- this is known as initialization, because we
          assign an initial value to a variable.
          <br /><br />
          However, we can also declare variables and assign variables
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score;</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text>
          </code>
        <p>When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
          <br><br>
          When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of a variable can be modified throughout the program
          (that's what makes it a <i>variable</i>, opposed to a
          <i>literal</i>)
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score = 0;</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text></code>
        <p>Here, initially, we set the score to 0.</p>
        <p>
          Later (after some more code -- not yet specified) we changed it to
          42.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to remember, however, that we CANNOT change the data
          type of a variable in Java within the same scope (we'll discuss
          scope a bit more later, for now just think of our scope limited to
          the main method)
        </p>

      <header>Printing Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          We can display the value of a variable using print or println.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> 
              <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//What should be printed below?</text>
              <text>System.out.println(score);</text>
            </code>
          <br />
          When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean the <b>value</b> of the variable.
          <br><br>
          To display the name of a variable, you have to put it in quotes.

          Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and
          values. For example, we know that + is an operator used for
          addition, while * is an operator used for multiplication.

      <header><b>Floating-point Numbers</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Floating-point numbers in Java are used to represent fractional values or numbers with a large range of
          possible values.
          They are primarily used when precise decimal calculations are not required.
          <br><br>
          Java uses two primitive data types to represent floating-point numbers: <b>float</b> and <b>double</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>float</b> data type is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number</li>
          <li>The <b>double</b> data type (which we will use in this class rather than float) is a 64-bit
            double-precision floating-point number.
            This makes the double data type more accurate than the float data type.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p> We can create double variables and assign values to them using
          the same syntax we used for the other types:
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>double payRate = 42.5;</text> </code>
          <br />
        </p>
        <header>Integer vs Floating Point Division</header>
        <p>In math, division ofter allows for remainders.
          It is why whenever a number is <b>NOT</b> evenly divisible by another number
          it can result in a decimal number opposed to a whole number
          e.g. 5/2 is equal to 2.5
          <br><br>
          However, <b>integer division</b> and division as we know from math class
          (also known as <b>floating-point division</b>) are two <b>different</b> ways of performing division
          operations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Integer division</b> is the division operation performed on two integers, resulting in an <b>integer
            quotient</b>.
          The result is obtained by discarding the fractional part of the division, if any.
          In other words, <b>it performs a "round towards zero" operation.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, if you perform an integer division of 10 divided by 3, the result is 3 because it discards
            the fractional part.</li>
          <li>Similarly, if you divide -10 by 3 using integer division, the result is -3, as it still rounds towards
            zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
        On the other hand, <b>floating-point division</b> is the division operation performed on floating-point numbers
        (those with decimal places).
        <b>It produces a result with decimal places</b>, including the fractional part.
        This type of division is typically <b>more accurate and provides more precise results</b>.
        </p>
        <p>In Java, when dividing two integers using the '/' operator,
          <b>integer division is performed if both operands are integers</b>.
          <br><br>
          To perform floating-point division, <b>at least one of the operands should be a floating-point number</b>.
          <br><br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <code><text>int result = 10 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Integer division, result is 3</text></text>
            <text>double result = 10.0 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Regular division, result is approximately 3.3333</text></code>
        </text>
        <p>It is important to be aware of the distinction between integer division and floating-point division,
          especially when working with different data types and when precision is required in calculations.</p>

      <header><b>Math Methods</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Java has a lot of built-in Math methods that allow us to perform more complex mathematical computations.
          The Math class is found in the java.lang package, so you don’t have to import it.
          <br><br>
          For example, if you need to get the square root of a number, we use the Math.sqrt() method.
        </p>
        <p>Some frequently used Math class methods include:</p>
        <ul>

      <header><b>Types of Errors</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are three types of errors can occur in a program:
        <ol>
          <li>Compiler errors</li>
          <li>Run-time errors</li>
          <li>Logic errors</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><b>Compiler errors</b> occur when you <b>violate the syntax rules</b> of the Java language.
          For example, forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement or
          that parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs.
          So (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is not.
          In the latter case, the program cannot be compiled, and the compiler displays an error.
        <ul>
          <li>Error messages from the compiler usually indicate where in the program the error occurred, and sometimes
            they can tell you exactly what the error is.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Run-time errors</b> occur while the interpreter is executing byte code
          and <b>something goes wrong</b>.
          These errors are also called “exceptions” because they usually
          indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
          (Example: attempting divide by zero)
        <ul>
          <li>When a run-time error occurs, the interpreter displays an
            error message that explains what happened and where.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The third type of error is the <b>logic error</b>.
          If your program has a logic error, it will compile and run
          without generating error messages, but <b>it will not do the right thing</b>.
          Instead, it will do exactly what you told it to do (even if it isn't the right solution).
        <ul>
          <li>Usually the compiler and the interpreter <b>CANNOT</b> help you,
            since they don’t know what the right thing is. </li>
        </ul>

         <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                  Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                  pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                  variables using the window.variable syntax.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                  or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                  frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                  declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                  iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
               </p>
            </article>
         </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                  You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                  The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                  identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                  and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
               </p>
               <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
               <p>
                  A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                  while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                  scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                  assumed to represent a variable.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                  variable in the same scope. For example:
               </p>
               <code
                  >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
               WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
               //statements }</code
                  >
               However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
               statement is executed without problems.
               <code
                  >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
               "otherValue";</code
                  >

         <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
               <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                           null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                           JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                           NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                           Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                           are unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>and Object</li>
               </ul>
               Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
               you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
               functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
               think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
               procedures that your application can perform.

         <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
               Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
               true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
               condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
               <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
               condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
               Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
               condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
               statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
               statement, including further nested if statements.
               <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
               </p>
               <code
                  >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
               statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
               statement_last; }
               </code>
               In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
               which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
               statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
               general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
               when nesting if statements:
               <code
                  >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
               statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
               statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
               statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
                  >
               It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
               expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
               glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
               <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
               an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
               additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
               <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

         <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
               A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
               condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
               <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
               false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
               the statement following the loop.
               <p>
                  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                  If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                  condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                  stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
               </p>
               <p>
                  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                  group those statements.
               </p>
               Example:
               <p>
                  The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
               </p>
               <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
               <p>
                  With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                  Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                  true, so the loop terminates.
               </p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <article>
               A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
               statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
               <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                     A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                     separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                     curly brackets, { }.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                  square:
               </p>
               <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
               <p>
                  The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                  consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                  function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                  statement specifies the value returned by the function.
               </p>
               <code>return number * number;</code>
               <p>
                  Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                  value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
                  changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                  globally or in the calling function.
