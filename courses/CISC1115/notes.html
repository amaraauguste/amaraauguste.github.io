      <header><b>Intro to Programming</b></header>
      <article>
      <p>
        In this class, we will write programs.
        <br /><br />
        But first, what is a program?
        <br /><br />
        A <b>program</b> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
        perform a computation. <br /><br />

        Every program you’ve
        ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that
        look much like the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>input:</b> get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>output:</b> display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>math:</b> perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>decisions:</b> check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>repetition:</b> perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can think of <b>programming</b> as the process of:
        <i>breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks.</i>
        <br><br>
        The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with
        the basic instructions provided by the computer.
      </p>
      </article>
      <br />
      <header>What is Computer Science?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding <i><b>how</b></i> to
          solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions.
          <br /><br />

          In order to determine which way is best for a given situation,
          we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Computer science</b> is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and
          analysis.
          <br /><br />
          An <b>algorithm</b> is a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a
          problem.
        <ul>
          <li>Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space
            in computer memory.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone.
          <br><br>
          For historical reasons, programming errors are called <b>bugs</b>, and the process of tracking them down and
          correcting them is called <b>debugging</b>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <header>Programming Languages</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The programming language you will learn in this class is <b>Java</b>, which is a high-level language.
            <br> <br>
            A <b>high-level language</b> is any programming language that enables development of a program
            in a much more <b>user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware
              architecture.</b>
            <br><br>
            Other high-level languages you may have heard of include:
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C and C++</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated
          into a <b>low-level language</b>, also called “machine language”.
          <br><br>
          This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            High-level languages have two advantages:
          <ol>
            <li>It is much <b>easier</b> to program in a high-level language.</li>
            <ul>
              <li> Programs take
                less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more
                likely to be correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>High-level languages are <b>portable</b>, meaning they can run on different
              kinds of computers with few or no modifications.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Low-level programs
                can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run
                on another.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages:
          <b>interpreters</b> and <b>compilers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>An <b>interpreter</b> reads a high-level program and
              executes it, meaning that it does what the program says.
              It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations</li>
            <br>
            <li>A <b>compiler</b> reads the entire program and translates it completely
              before the program starts running. In this context, the high-level program is called the <b>source
                code</b>, and the translated program is called the object
              code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it
              repeatedly without further translation. As a result, <b>compiled programs often
                run faster than interpreted programs.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <header><b>What is Java?</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
          language and software platform that runs on billions of devices,
          including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles,
          medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are
          based on the C and C++ languages.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some specific examples of real world applications that use Java: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn</li>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create an application using Java, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK),
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">which is available for Windows, macOS, and
              Linux</a>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A command-line interface (CLI) on your computer that allows you to
            create and delete files, run programs, and navigate through
            folders and files (<b>On a Mac, it's called Terminal, and on Windows, it's Command
              Prompt</b>) OR an integrated development environment (IDE) - a software
            application that helps programmers develop software code
            efficiently by combining capabilities such as software editing,
            building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application,
            such as
            <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>,
            <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html">NetBeans</a>,
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows">IntelliJ</a>, <a
              href="https://drjava.sourceforge.net/">DrJava</a>, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You write the program in the Java programming language, then a
          compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set
          for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java
          runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification
          on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run
          anywhere. The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java
          API, and a complete development environment. The JVM parses and runs
          (interprets) the Java bytecode.

          security functions; Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and
          web services. Taken together, the Java language and the Java
          software platform create a powerful, proven technology for
          enterprise software development.

      <header><b>Hello World</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          To start programming in Java, we can write a simple program that
          outputs "Hello, World!" on the screen. Since it's a very simple
          program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to
          a newbie! 😃
        </p>
        <p>Let's explore how Java "Hello, World!" program works:</p>
        <code><text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">// Our First Program</text>
            <text>public class HelloWorld {</text>
            <text style="margin-left: 40px"
              >public static void main(String[] args) {</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 80px"
              >System.out.println("Hello, World!");</text
            >
            <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
            <text>}</text>
          </code>
        <br />
        <p><b>How does the "Hello, World!" program work?</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In Java, any line starting with // is a <b>single-line</b> comment
            (We will learn more about multi-line comments in a bit). Comments
            are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent
            and functionality of the program. It is completely ignored by the
            Java compiler (an application that translates Java program to Java
            bytecode that computer can execute).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Every application begins with a class definition. In this
            particular program, HelloWorld is the name of the class and the
            name of the class should match the filename in Java.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Next is the main method. Every application in Java must contain
            the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from
            the main method, and it's mandatory in each of our executable Java
            programs. The signature of the main method in Java is:
            <br /><br />
            <text style="margin-left: 10px">public static void main(String [] args) { ... }</text>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Lastly, we have a print statement. It prints the text Hello,
            World! to standard output (your screen). The text inside the
            quotation marks is called a String <i>literal</i> in Java.
            <b>Notice the print statement is inside the main function, which
              is inside the class definition.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <br />
      <header>Comments</header>
      <article>

      <header><b>Variables</b></header>
      <p>
        You may have seen variables before (Think back to high school algebra!
        Solving for X, etc.)
        <br /><br />
        In programming, a variable is a location in memory (storage area) that
        holds data.
        <br /><br />
        (For now just one value at a time ... we'll come back to this later)
        <br /><br />
        To indicate the storage area, each variable is given a unique name.
        The names of variables, called <b>identifiers</b>, conform to the
        following rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identifiers CANNOT be a keyword (ex. keywords like int, for, class,
          etc CANNOT be used as a variable name (or identifier) as they are
          part of the Java programming language syntax
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers are case-sensitive (ex. age, AGE, Age, etc. are all
          valid identifiers and can all exist within the same program,
          although NOT RECOMMENDED 😡)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers can be made up of a sequence of letters and digits.
          However,
          <b>it must begin with a letter, '$' (dollar sign) or '_'
            (underscore).</b>
          (It is convention to start an identifier with a letter) The first
          letter of an identifier CANNOT be a digit.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Identifiers CANNOT contain whitespaces, nor symbols such as @, #,
          and so on.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Examples of <b>VALID</b> ✔️ identifiers:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>player1</li>
          <li>score</li>
          <li>level</li>
          <li>highScore</li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <li>Examples of <b>INVALID</b> ❌ identifiers:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>pl@yer</li>
          <li>1score</li>
          <li>class</li>
          <li>highest Score</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <br />
      <article>
        It is easy to declare a variable!
        <br />
        <p>
          First we identify the necessary keyword for the variable datatype.
          For example, a whole number should be declared as an integer type
          known as int while a decimal number should be declared as a float or
          double.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> </code>
          <br />
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables
          (we'll talk about this more later 😉).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the previous example, we have assigned value to the variable
          during declaration -- this is known as initialization, because we
          assign an initial value to a variable.
          <br /><br />
          However, we can also declare variables and assign variables
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score;</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text>
          </code>
        <p>When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
          <br><br>
          When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of a variable can be modified throughout the program
          (that's what makes it a <i>variable</i>, opposed to a
          <i>literal</i>)
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <code><text>int score = 0;</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>...</text>
            <text>score = 42;</text></code>
        <p>Here, initially, we set the score to 0.</p>
        <p>
          Later (after some more code -- not yet specified) we changed it to
          42.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to remember, however, that we CANNOT change the data
          type of a variable in Java within the same scope (we'll discuss
          scope a bit more later, for now just think of our scope limited to
          the main method)
        </p>

      <header>Printing Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          We can display the value of a variable using print or println.
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>int score = 42;</text> 
              <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//What should be printed below?</text>
              <text>System.out.println(score);</text>
            </code>
          <br />
          When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean the <b>value</b> of the variable.
          <br><br>
          To display the name of a variable, you have to put it in quotes.
        </p>

      <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                The scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
               </p>
               <p>
                In general, a set of curly brackets { } defines a scope. 
                <br><br>
                <b>A variable declared inside pair of brackets “{” and “}” in a method is only accessible within the scope of the brackets only.</b>
                (This will make more sense when we explore conditional statements, loops, methods, etc.)
               </p>

      <header>Global/Member Variables</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                We can also declare variables directly inside the class (outside any specific method -- we will revisit this once we begin writing more methods). 
                <br><br>
                <b>These variables can be directly accessed anywhere in class.</b>

          addition, while * is an operator used for multiplication.

      <header><b>Floating-point Numbers</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Floating-point numbers in Java are used to represent fractional values or numbers with a large range of
          possible values.
          They are primarily used when precise decimal calculations are not required.
          <br><br>
          Java uses two primitive data types to represent floating-point numbers: <b>float</b> and <b>double</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>float</b> data type is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number</li>
          <li>The <b>double</b> data type (which we will use in this class rather than float) is a 64-bit
            double-precision floating-point number.
            This makes the double data type more accurate than the float data type.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p> We can create double variables and assign values to them using
          the same syntax we used for the other types:
          <br /><br />
          <code><text>double payRate = 42.5;</text> </code>
        </p>
        <p>The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer 
          is to use a <b>type cast</b>, so called because it molds or “casts” 
          a value from one type to another.</p>
          <p>
            The syntax for type casting is to put the name of the type 
            in parentheses and use it as an operator.</p>
          <code><text>double payRate = 42.5;</text> 
            <text>int pay = (int) payRate;</text></code>
          <p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>What is the value of the variable pay?</b></p>
        <header>Integer vs Floating Point Division</header>
        <p>In math, division often allows for remainders.
          It is why whenever a number is <b>NOT</b> evenly divisible by another number
          it can result in a decimal number opposed to a whole number
          e.g. 5/2 is equal to 2.5
          <br><br>
          However, <b>integer division</b> and division as we know from math class
          (also known as <b>floating-point division</b>) are two <b>different</b> ways of performing division
          operations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Integer division</b> is the division operation performed on two integers, resulting in an <b>integer
            quotient</b>.
          The result is obtained by discarding the fractional part of the division, if any.
          In other words, <b>it performs a "round towards zero" operation.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, if you perform an integer division of 10 divided by 3, the result is 3 because it discards
            the fractional part.</li>
          <li>Similarly, if you divide -10 by 3 using integer division, the result is -3, as it still rounds towards
            zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
        On the other hand, <b>floating-point division</b> is the division operation performed on floating-point numbers
        (those with decimal places).
        <b>It produces a result with decimal places</b>, including the fractional part.
        This type of division is typically <b>more accurate and provides more precise results</b>.
        </p>
        <p>In Java, when dividing two integers using the '/' operator,
          <b>integer division is performed if both operands are integers</b>.
          <br><br>
          To perform floating-point division, <b>at least one of the operands should be a floating-point number</b>.
          <br><br>
          For example:
        </p>
        <code><text>int result = 10 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Integer division, result is 3</text></text>
            <text>double result = 10.0 / 3;<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Regular division, result is approximately 3.3333</text></code>
        </text>
        <p>It is important to be aware of the distinction between integer division and floating-point division,
          especially when working with different data types and when precision is required in calculations.</p>

      <header><b>Math Methods</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Java has a lot of built-in Math methods that allow us to perform more complex mathematical computations.
          The Math class is found in the java.lang package, so you don’t have to import it.
          <br><br>
          For example, if you need to get the square root of a number, we use the Math.sqrt() method.
        </p>
        <p>Some frequently used Math class methods include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Math.abs</b>(n) - for computing the absolute value of a particular number</li>
          <li><b>Math.sqrt</b>(n) - for computing the square root of a particular number</li>
          <li><b>Math.pow</b>(base, exp) - for computing the result of a particular base raised to the power of a
            particular exponent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can learn more about the Java Math class methods from the Java API <a

      <header>Generating Random Numbers</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Most computer programs do the same thing every time they run, 
          meaning they are <b>deterministic</b>. Usually we want our
          programs to be deterministic since we expect the same 
          calculation to yield the same result. But for certain applications (e.g. games)
          we want to write programs that are <b>nondeterministic.</b>
          <br><br>
          It is hard for a computer to generate <i>truly</i> random numbers. But there are algorithms
          that generate unpredictable sequences called <b>pseudorandom</b> numbers. For
          most applications, <b>they are as good as random.</b>
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Math.random()</b> method returns a pseudorandom 
        double type number between 0.0 and 1.0, 
        where 0.0 is <b>inclusive</b> and 1.0 is <b>exclusive.</b></p>
        <p>When this method is first called, 
          it creates a single new pseudorandom-number generator</p>
          <code><text>public class RandomExample {</text>
          <text style="margin-left: 40px"
            >public static void main(String[] args) {</text
          >
          <text style="margin-left: 80px">double rand = Math.random();<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//Generate random number</text></text>

          <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>

      <br />
      <header><b>Types of Errors</b></header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are three types of errors can occur in a program:
        <ol>
          <li>Compiler errors</li>
          <li>Run-time errors</li>
          <li>Logic errors</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><b>Compiler errors</b> occur when you <b>violate the syntax rules</b> of the Java language.
          For example, forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement or
          that parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs.
          So (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is not.
          In the latter case, the program cannot be compiled, and the compiler displays an error.
        <ul>
          <li>Error messages from the compiler usually indicate where in the program the error occurred, and sometimes
            they can tell you exactly what the error is.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Run-time errors</b> occur while the interpreter is executing byte code
          and <b>something goes wrong</b>.
          These errors are also called “exceptions” because they usually
          indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
          (Example: attempting divide by zero)
        <ul>
          <li>When a run-time error occurs, the interpreter displays an
            error message that explains what happened and where.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The third type of error is the <b>logic error</b>.
          If your program has a logic error, it will compile and run
          without generating error messages, but <b>it will not do the right thing</b>.
          Instead, it will do exactly what you told it to do (even if it isn't the right solution).
        <ul>
          <li>Usually the compiler and the interpreter <b>CANNOT</b> help you,
            since they don’t know what the right thing is. </li>
        </ul>

  <article>
    <p>
      So far we have used <b>System.out.println()</b> to display text to the
      screen. But what does it actually mean? <br /><br />
      <b>System</b> is a class (that belongs to the java.lang package,
       which is imported automatically) that provides methods related to the “system” or
      environment where programs run. 
    </p>
    <p>
      System.out represents the <b><i>Standard Output Stream</i></b
      >. That means that if we want to print any statement on the console, we
      should use the following statement: <br /><br />
      <text style="margin: 80px; font-size: 50px">System.out.print();</text>
    </p>
    <p>There are three methods we use to print statements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>print(String s)</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Used to print on the console.</li>
        <li>Accepts a string as a parameter (we can concatenate parts to 
          the string if necessary, i.e. “Hello” + “ World”, etc. 
          however, it is typical convention to include all string literals 
          in the same pair of quotations if they are consecutive) </li>
        <li>After printing the statement, <b>the cursor remains on the same line.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>println(String s)</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>An upgraded version of the print() method, 
          also used to display text on the console.</li>
        <li>After printing the statement, 
          it throws <b>the cursor at the start of the next line.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>printf(String format, datatype args)</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Accepts two parameters:</li>
            <ul>
              <li style="list-style-type: circle"><b>format</b>: It is a formatted String, uses placeholders 
                with specific conversion characters to refer to the 
                arguments that will be replaced when printing</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: circle">
                <b>args</b>: It is an argument referenced by the format specifiers. 
                If the number of arguments is more than the format specifiers, the other arguments are ignored. 
                The number of arguments may be zero.
              </li>
            </ul>

    <p>As we previously discussed, a variable in Java must be declared as a specific

        <li><b>Primitive Data Types</b>, which specify the <b>size and type of variable values</b> and has <b>no additional methods</b></li>

    <p>The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Primitive types are <b>predefined</b> (already defined) in Java. 
        Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not 
        defined by Java (except for <b>String</b>)</li>
        <br>
      <li>Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to 
        perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.</li>
        <br>
      <li>A primitive type has always a value, 
        while non-primitive types can be null.</li>
        <br>
      <li>A primitive type <b>starts with a lowercase letter</b>, 
        while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter. (e.g. Strings, etc.) </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <br>
  <header>Strings (part 1)</header>
  <article>
  <p>We will revisit the concept of Strings in depth a bit later but for now just know that 
    <b>Strings</b> contain a sequence of “characters” strung together.</p>
  <p> Characters can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, 
    symbols, spaces, tabs, etc.</p>
    <p>We can initialize a String simply by stating: </p>
    <code><text>String s = "Hello";</text></code>
    <p>In most cases, we can use a String as a variable data type just like we have for int, double, etc. 
      (Although all Strings we create are technically <i>objects</i> and have more behaviors than the primitive data types --
    but we'll talk more about that later) </p>
    </article>
    <br>
  <header>Operators for Strings</header>
  <article>
  <p>In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if
    the strings look like numbers. The following expressions are illegal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Hello" - 1</li>
      <li>"World" / 123</li>
      <li>"Hello" * "World"</li>
    </ul>
   <p>However, the <b>+</b> operator DOES work with strings. <br><br> For
    strings, the + operator performs <b>concatenation</b>, which means joining end-to-end. </p>
      <p>So "Hello, " + "World!" yields the string "Hello, World!".</p>
    <p>Or if you have a variable called name that has type String, the expression
      "Hello, " + name <b>appends the value of name to the hello string</b>, which creates
      a personalized greeting</p>
      <p>Since addition is defined for both numbers and strings, 
        Java performs automatic conversions you may not expect:</p>
      
        <p>What do we expect the following code to print?</p>
        <code><text>String s = "Hello";</text>
        <text>System.out.println(1 + 2 + s);</text></code>
      
      <p>How about this one?</p>
      <code><text>System.out.println(s + 1 + 2);</text></code>
      <br>
      <p>Java executes these operations <b>from left to right</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the first example, 1 + 2 is
          3, and 3 + the value of variable s ("Hello") is <b>"3Hello"</b></li>
          <br>
        <li>In the second example, "Hello" + 1 is
          "Hello1", and "Hello1" + 2 is <b>"Hello12"</b></li>
      </ul>

  <header><b>The Scanner Class</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>
      The System class also provides the special value <b>System.in</b>, which
      is an InputStream that provides methods for reading input from the
      keyboard. These methods are not easy to use; fortunately, Java provides
      other classes that make it easier to handle common input tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All reading done in Java uses the <b>Scanner</b> class. Using this class,
      we can create an object to read input from the standard input channel
      System.in (in our case, the keyboard)
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the Scanner class, it is necessary to <b>import the class Scanner from
      the library java.util</b> by including the following line at the top (before the class declaration) of
      program: 
    </p>
    <code><text>import java.util.Scanner;</text></code>
    <p>We can declare a Scanner object by saying:</p>
    <code><text>Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);</text></code>
    <ul>
      <li>
        sc is the <b>name of the Scanner object</b> (this can be changed and is
        entirely up to the person who writes the code)
      </li>
      <li>
        and System.in connects our object to <b>standard input</b> (the keyboard)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Scanner class has multiple built-in methods that we can access to help
      us read data, for example: we can use <b>sc.nextLine()</b> to read in a line of
      String(s) (spaces included)
    </p>
    <p>Other methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>nextBoolean()</b>: reads a boolean value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextByte()</b>: reads a byte value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextDouble()</b>: reads a double value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextFloat()</b>: reads a float value from the user</li>
      <li><b>nextInt()</b>: reads a int value from the user</li>
      <li>
        <b>next()</b>: reads a complete token (String) from the user. A complete token
        is preceded and followed by input that matches the delimiter pattern, in
        most instances this is a space
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When we are done reading in data, it is customary to <b>CLOSE</b> the Scanner to avoid 
      a possible memory leak. This is simple, we would just state thr following:
    </p>
    <code><text>sc.close();</text></code>
    <p>Once we no longer need the Scanner (this is typically found at the last could lines of the method)</p>

  <header>The Scanner Bug</header>
  <article>
    <p>Now that we have had some experience with Scanner, we need to talk about some unexpected
      behavior that may occur</p>
      <p>When you read a String followed by an int, everything works just fine.But
        when you read an int followed by a String, something strange happens.</p>
      <code><text>System.out.print("What is your age? ");</text>
      <text>age = in.nextInt();</text>
      <text>System.out.print("What is your name? ");</text>
      <text>name = in.nextLine();</text>
      <text>System.out.printf("Hello %s, age %d\n", name, age);</text></code>

        <p>Try running this example code. It doesn't let you input your name, and it
          immediately displays the output:</p>
         <p>What is your name? Hello , age 45</p> 
          <p>When you call nextInt(), it reads characters until it gets to a non-digit.
            At this point, nextInt() returns 45. The program then displays the prompt
            "What is your name? " and calls nextLine(), which reads characters until it
            gets to a newline. <b>But since the next character is already a newline, nextLine
            returns the empty string "".</b>
          </p>
      <p>To solve this problem, you need an extra nextLine() after nextInt()</p>
      <code><text>System.out.print("What is your age? ");</text>
      <text>age = in.nextInt();</text>
      <text>in.nextLine();<text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px"
        >// read the newline</text
      ></text>
      <text>System.out.print("What is your name? ");</text>
      <text>name = in.nextLine();</text>
      <text>System.out.printf("Hello %s, age %d\n", name, age);</text></code>
      <p>This technique is common when reading int or double values that appear on
        their own line. <br><br><b>First you read the number, and then you read the rest of the
        line, which is just a newline character.</b></p>

</article>
<br>
  <header>Example: Inches to Centimeters</header>
  <article>
  <p>Now let's see an example, We will use a <b>Scanner</b> to input a measurement
    in inches, convert to centimeters, and then display the results.</p>

    <p>First let's declare the variables and create the Scanner object that we will call <b>input</b></p>
    <code><text>int inches;</text>
    <text>double cm;</text>
    <text>Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);</text></code>

  <p>Next, let's <b>prompt</b> the user for the input (prompts are important because they let the user know HOW they should interact with the program)</p>

  <p>We'll use print() instead of println() so they can enter the input on the <b>same line as the prompt</b>
    and use the Scanner method nextInt(), which reads input from the keyboard
    and <b>converts it to an integer</b></p>
    <code><text>System.out.print("Enter # of inches: ");</text>
    <text>inches = input.nextInt();</text></code>

  <p>Now we can multiply the number of inches entered by <b>2.54</b> (the number of centimeters there are per inch)
    and display the results</p>
    <code><text>cm = inches * 2.54;</text>
    <text>System.out.print(inches + " inches = ");</text>
    <text>System.out.printf("%.2f cm%n", cm);</text></code>

  <p>This code works but it does have a minor flaw. If another programmer
    reads this code, they might wonder where 2.54 comes from.</p>

  <p><b>How can we modify this for clarity?</b></p>

  <article>
    <p>A value that appears in a program, like 2.54 (or " inches = "), is called a <b>literal</b>.
      <br><br>
      In general, there is nothing wrong with literals. 
      <br><br>
      But when numbers like 2.54 appear in an expression with no explanation, they make code hard to read.
      And if the same value appears many times, and might have to change in the
      future, it <b>makes code hard to maintain</b>.
    </p>
    <p>For the benefit of others (and yourself in the future), it would be better to assign this value to
      a variable with a meaningful name:</p>
      <code><text>double cmPerInch = 2.54;</text>
      <text>cm = inches * cmPerInch;</text></code>
    <p>This version is easier to read and less error-prone, but it still has a problem.
      <b>Variables can vary</b>, but the number of centimeters in an inch does not.</p>
    <p>Once we assign a value to cmPerInch, it should never change.</p>
    <p>Luckily, Java provides a language feature that enforces that rule, the keyword <b>final</b>.</p>
    <code><text>final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;</text></code>
    <p>Declaring a variable as <b>final</b> means that it cannot be reassigned once
      it has been initialized. If you try, <b>the compiler reports an error</b>. </p>
    <p>Variables declared as final are called <b>constants</b>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By convention, names for constants are <b>all uppercase</b>, with the underscore character (_) between words.</li>

  <header><b>Reading from a File</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>
      As previously mentioned, we use a Scanner to read data whether or not the data is from the keyboard or a file. 
      <b>To read from a file we only need to make one or two modifications from what we learned from reading from the keyboard.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      First, since we are using files we need to allow our program(s) to use them by including:
    </p>
    <code><text>import java.io.File; <text style="color: rgb(65, 180, 252)">//import the File class</text></text
    ></code>
    <p>Since we are dealing with files, we HAVE to add a <b>throws Exception</b> declaration to main:</p> 
      <code><text>public static void main (String [] args) throws Exception { </text></code> 
      <p>and create the File object that we will be reading from:</p>
    <code><text>File file = new File("[filename].txt");</text></code>
    <p>And create a Scanner like we have previously done, only changing our reference from the keyboard to the corresponding file object:</p>
    <code><text>Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);</text></code>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important that you remember to create the .txt file that you are trying to 
        reading from and make sure that it is in the correct directory or to specify the path 
        where the file is located when creating the File object else you will receive a <b>FileNotFoundException</b> 
        when you attempt to run your code.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <br />
  <header>Writing to a File</header>
  <article>
    <p>
      We already know about writing data to the screen by using System.out, 
      but how about writing data to an outside source such as a file?
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing to a file is slightly less work since we do not have 
      to manually create the .txt file ourselves prior to running the program, 
      the program will do the creation for us. There are many different ways to 
      write to file in Java but in this class we will keep it relatively 
      simple and use the <b>PrintWriter</b> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like before, we need to import the PrintWriter class in order to use it:
    </p>
    <code><text>import java.io.PrintWriter;</text></code>
    <p>Whether we are writing or reading, we are still dealing with files so we still HAVE to add a <b>throws Exception</b> declaration to main:</p> 
      <code><text>public static void main (String [] args) throws Exception { </text></code> 
      <p>and create the File object that we will be reading from:</p>
    <p>We will use the PrintWriter class to create our file:</p>
    <code><text>PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("[filename].txt");</text></code>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important to make sure that the filename that you are trying to create
       <b>does not already exist</b> in the directory that you are trying to create it in 
        otherwise, you will overwrite the file and lose your original file data 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now we can use the PrintWriter object to write, the same way that we wrote
      to the screen only replacing System.out with our PrintWriter object, 
      i.e. pw.print(), pw.println(), pw.printf(), etc.
    </p>
    <p>Just like with the Scanner, we need to <b>CLOSE</b> the PrintWriter object:
    </p>
    <code><text>pw.close();</text></code>
    <p> The intepreter only knows that the program is finished writing
      to the file <b>after we close</b> the PrintWriter, so if we forget to close 
      the PrintWriter the file may appear empty.

  <header><b>Relational Operators</b></header>
  <article>
    <p>So far we have seen programs that do pretty much the same thing
      every time, regardless of the input. For more complex computations, 
      programs usually <b>react to the inputs, check for certain conditions, 
      and generate appropriate results.</b> </p>
      <p>We mentioned relational operators briefly before but let's discuss how 
        they work, more in depth:
      </p>
      <p><b>Relational operators</b> are used to <b>check conditions like whether two values
        are equal, or whether one is greater than the other.</b></p>
        <table class="relation">
          <tr>
            <td><b>x == y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is equal to y</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>x != y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is not equal to y</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>x > y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is greater than y</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>x < y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is less than y</td> 
          </tr>
           <tr>
            <td><b>x >= y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is greater than or equal to y</td> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>x <= y</b></td>
            <td style="color: green">// x is less than or equal to y</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>You have probably seen these operations before, but it is important to note that the Java
          operators are different from the mathematical symbols like =, &#8800;, and ≤.</p>
        <p> A common error is to use a single = instead of a double == </p>
        <p> Remember that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>=</b> is the <b>assignment</b> operator</li>
          <li> and <b>==</b> is a <b>comparison</b> operator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The two sides of a relational operator must be <b>compatible</b></p>
        <p>For example, the expression: <b>5 < "6"</b> is <b>invalid because 5 is an int and "6" is a String</b></p>
        <p>However, when evaluating the expression <b>5 (an int) < 6.0 (a double)</b>, 
          Java <b>automatically converts the 5 to 5.0</b> because when comparing values of different 
          numeric types, Java applies the same conversion rules we saw previously with the assignment operator.</p>

        <p>The result of a relational operator is one of two special values, either <text style="color:blue"><b>true</b></text> or <text style="color:blue"><b>false</b></text>.
          <br><br>
          These values belong to the data type <b>boolean</b>. In fact, they are the only
          boolean values.</p>

    <div class="container" style="width: 100%; display: table;">


      <div style="display: table-row">
        <div style="width: 50%; display: table-cell;">
        <p>Java has three logical operators:</p>
       <ul style="list-style: none;">
          <li><b>&&</b></li>
          <li><b>||</b></li>
          <li>and <b>!</b></li>
        </ul> 
        </div>
    
        <div style="display: table-cell;">
           <p>Which respectively stand for:</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li><b>and</b></li>
            <li><b>or</b></li>
            <li>and <b>not</b></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <p>The results of these operators are similar to their meanings
        in English.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>(x > 0 && x < 10)</b> is <text style="color: blue"><b>true</b></text> when <text style="font-size: 35px;">x is <b>both</b> greater than zero <b>and</b>
            less than 10</text></li>
          <li>The expression <b>(evenFlag || n % 3 == 0)</b> is <text style="color: blue"><b>true</b></text> if <text style="font-size: 35px;"><b>either</b> condition 
            is true, that is, if evenFlag is true <b>or</b> the number n is divisible by 3</text></li>
            <li>And the ! operator inverts a boolean expression, so <b>!evenFlag</b> is <text style="color: blue"><b>true</b></text> 
              <text style="font-size: 35px;">if evenFlag is <b>not true (false)</b></text>
              </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Logical operators evaluate the second expression only when necessary. For
          example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>(<text style="color: blue">true</text> || anything)</b> is always <text style="color: blue"><b>true</b></text>, 
              so Java does not need to evaluate the expression <b>anything</b></li>
            <li>and <b>(<text style="color: blue">false</text> && anything)</b> is <b>always <text style="color: blue">false</text></b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ignoring the second operand, when possible, is called <b>short circuit evaluation</b>, by analogy with an electrical circuit.</p>

          <p>Short circuit evaluation can save time, especially if <b>anything</b> takes a long time to evaluate. 
            It can also avoid unnecessary errors, if <b>anything</b> might fail.</p>

  <header>De Morgan's Laws</header>
  <article>
    <p>If I told you I would show you a picture of a <b>blue square</b> and then you saw the picture and it <b>wasn’t true</b>, which part of my claim “a blue square” wasn’t true? <br><br>
      Maybe it was a square and it was a color other than blue? Or maybe it wasn't even a square at all? Maybe it was neither blue NOR a square entirely? <br><br>
      You could write this as a logic statement like below using negation (!) and the AND (&&) operator since <b>both parts have to be true for the whole statement to be true</b>.</p>
      <code><text>!(a && b)</text>
      <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//a = "blue"</text>
      <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//b = "square"</text></code>
    <p>If you ever have to negate an expression that contains logical operators, and you probably 
      will, <b>De Morgan’s laws</b> can help.</p>
    <p>De Morgan’s Laws were developed by Augustus De Morgan in the 1800s. 
      They show how to simplify the negation of a complex boolean expression, 
      which is when there are multiple expressions joined by an AND (&&) or OR (||), such as <br><b>(x < 3) && (y > 2)</b>. <br><br>
      Negating a logical expression is the same as negating each term and changing the operator. 
      The ! operator takes precedence over && and ||, so you don’t have to put parentheses around the individual terms <b>!A</b> and <b>!B</b>.
     </p>
      <p>Here’s an easy way to remember De Morgan’s Laws:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>move the NOT inside, AND becomes OR </li>
        <li>and move the NOT inside, OR becomes AND</li>
      </ul>
      <img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" src="https://github.com/amaraauguste/amaraauguste.github.io/blob/master/courses/CISC1115/images/demorgan.png?raw=true" alt="De Morgan's Law"/>
     <p>In Java, De Morgan’s Laws are written with the following operators:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>!(a && b)</b> is equivalent to <b>!a || !b</b></li>
      <li><b>!(a || b)</b> is equivalent to <b>!a && !b</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Going back to our example above, using De Morgan’s Laws:</p> 
     <ul style="list-style: none">
      <li><b>!("blue" && "square")</b> is equivalent to <b>!("blue") or !("square")</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>You can also simplify negated boolean expressions that have relational operators like <, >, ==. You can remove negation by moving it inside and flipping the relational operator to its opposite sign. 
      <br><br>For example, <b>(!) not (c equals d) is the same as saying c does not equal d</b>.</p>
      <p>An easy way to remember this is to:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: none">
        <li><b>Move the NOT inside, flip the sign</b></li>
        <li>i.e. <b>== becomes !=, < becomes >=, and > becomes <=</b></li>
      </ul> 
      <p>In this case, negating each term means using the “opposite” relational operator. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>!(x < 5 && y == 3)</b> is the same as <b>x >= 5 || y != 3</b></li>
        <li><b>!(x >= 1 || y != 7)</b> is the same as <b>x < 1 && y == 7</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>It may help to read these examples out loud in English. For instance, <b>"If I
        don’t want the case where <text style="font-size: 35px">x is less than 5 and y is 3</text>, then I 
        need <text style="font-size: 35px">x to be greater than or equal to 5, or I need y to be anything but 3</text>."</b></p>
      <p>You should be able to show that two boolean expressions are equivalent. 
        One way to do this is by using <b>truth tables</b>.
        <br><br>For example, we can show that <b>!(a && b) == !a || !b</b> by constructing the truth table below 
        and seeing that they give identical results for the 2 expressions (the last 2 columns in the table below are identical!):</p>
        <table class="truth">
          <tr>
            <th>a</th>
            <th>b</th>
            <th>!(a && b)</th>
            <th>!a || !b</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>false</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr>
        </table>  
        <p>Often, you can <b>simplify boolean expressions to create equivalent expressions</b>. <br><br>
          For example, applying De Morgan’s Laws to <b>!(x < 3 && y > 2) yields !(x < 3) || !(y > 2)</b> as seen in the figure below. 
          <br><br>
          This can then be simplified further by <b>moving the not operator inside and flipping the relation operators</b>. 
          So, <b>!(x < 3) || !(y > 2) is simplified to (x >= 3 || y <= 2)</b> where the relational operators are flipped and the negation is removed. 
          These two simplification steps are seen below.</p>

  <br />
  <header><b>Conditional Statements</b></header>
  <article>
  <p>Our programs have so far been linear. In other words, the programs have executed from top to bottom without major surprises or conditional 
    behavior. <br><br> However, we usually want to add <b>conditional logic</b> to our programs. By this we mean functionality that's in one way or another 
    <b>dependent on the state of the program's variables</b>. <br><br>
    To branch the execution of a program based on user input, for example, we need to use something known as a <b>conditional statement</b>. </p>
  <header>The if Statements</header>
  <p>The simplest conditional statement in Java is the <b>if statement</b>:</p>
  <code><text>if (x > 0) {</text>
  <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
  <text>}</text></code>
  <p>An if statement specifies a statement(s) to be executed <b>only if a particular boolean expression is true</b></p>
  <p>The expression in parentheses is called the <b>condition</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it is <text style="color: blue;"><b>true</b></text>, the <b>statements in braces get executed</b>.</li>
    <li>If the condition is <text style="color: blue;"><b>false</b></text>, execution <b>skips over that block of code</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The condition in parentheses can be any boolean expression.</p>        
  </article>
  <br />
  <header>An if/else Block</header>
  <article>
   <p>A second form of conditional statement has two possibilities, indicated by <b>if</b> and <b>else</b>.</p>
   <p>The possibilities are called <b>branches</b>, and the condition determines which one gets executed:</p>
   <code><text>if (x > 0) {</text>
   <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
   <text>} else {</text>
   <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is NOT positive");</text>
   <text>}</text></code>
   <p>If the value of x is greated than zero, we know that x is positive, and this code fragment displays a message to that effect.</p>
   <p>If the condition is false, the second print statement is executed instead. Since the condition must be <text style="color:blue"><b>true</b></text> or <text style="color:blue"><b>false</b></text>, 
    exactly one of the branches will run.</p>
    <p>The <b>braces are optional for branches that have only one statement</b>. So we could have written the previous example this way:</p>
    <code><text>if (x > 0)</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
    <text>else </text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is NOT positive");</text></code>
  <p>However, it’s better to use braces – even when they are optional – to avoid
    making the mistake of adding statements to an if or else block and forgetting
    to add the braces.</p>
    <code><text>if (x > 0)</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is NOT positive");</text></code>
   <p>This code is misleading because it’s not indented correctly. Since there are no braces, 
    only the first println is part of the if statement. Here is what the compiler actually sees:</p> 
   <code><text>if (x > 0) {</text>
   <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
   <text>}</text>
   <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is NOT positive");</text></code>
   <p>As a result, <b>the second println runs no matter what</b>. <br><br>Even experienced
    programmers make this mistake; check out 
    <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/understanding-apple-goto-fail-vulnerability-2.html">Apple’s “goto fail” bug.</a></p>
  </article>
  <br />
  <header>Ternary Operator</header>
  <article>
   <p>There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the <b>ternary operator</b> because it consists of three operands.</p>
   <p>It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if/else statements:</p>
   <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
   <img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" src="https://github.com/amaraauguste/amaraauguste.github.io/blob/master/courses/CISC1115/images/ternary.png?raw=true" alt="ternary operator"/>
   <p>So we can modify our previous if/else block using the ternary operator as follows:</p>
   <code><text>String result = (x > 0) ? "x is positive" : "x is NOT positive";</text>
   <text>System.out.println(result);</text></code>

<section class="main-section" id="Chaining_and_Nesting">
  <br />
  <header><b>Chaining and Nesting</b></header>
  <article>
  <p>Sometimes you want to check related conditions and choose one of several
    actions. One way to do this is by <b>chaining</b> a series of if and else statements.</p>
    <br />
  </article>
    <header>The else if Statement</header>
    <article>
    <p>We can use the <b>else if</b> statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.</p>
    <img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" src="https://github.com/amaraauguste/amaraauguste.github.io/blob/master/courses/CISC1115/images/else%20if%20block.png?raw=true" alt="else if"/>
    <p>These chains can be as long as you want, although they can be difficult to
      read if they get out of hand. <br><br>One way to make them easier to read is to use
      <b>standard indentation</b>, as demonstrated in these examples. <b>If you keep all the
      statements and braces lined up, you are less likely to make syntax errors</b>.</p>
    <p>We can modify out previous if/else block (either printing out "x is positive" or "x is NOT positive") to include more specific options:</p>
    <code><text>if (x > 0){</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
    <text>} else if (x < 0) {</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is negative");</text>
    <text>} else {</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is zero");</text>
    <text>}</text></code>
    <p>Now we can further specify for values of x that are not positive, whether they be 0 or a negative number.</p>
  </article>
  <br />
    <header>Nested if Statements</header>
    <article>
    <p>In addition to chaining, you can also make complex decisions by <b>nesting</b> one
      conditional statement inside another. We could have written the previous
      example as:</p>
    <code><text>if (x > 0){</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
    <text>} else {</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">if (x < 0) {</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 80px">System.out.println("x is negative");</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">} else {</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 80px">System.out.println("x is zero");</text>
    <text style="margin-left: 40px">}</text>
    <text>}</text></code>
    <p>The <b>outer conditional has two branches</b>. <br><br><b>The first branch contains a print
      statement, and the second branch contains another conditional statement,
      which has two branches of its own</b>. <br><br>
      These two branches are also print statements, but they could have been conditional statements as well.</p>
    <p>These kinds of nested structures are common, but they get difficult to read
      very quickly. <b>Good indentation</b> is essential to make the structure (or intended
      structure) apparent to the reader.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Flag_Variables">
  <br />
  <header><b>Flag Variables</b></header>
  <article>
  <p>To store a <text style="color:blue"><b>true</b></text> or <text style="color:blue"><b>false</b></text> value, you need a <text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> variable. 
   <br><br>You can create one like this:</p>  
  <code><text><text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> flag; <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//variable declaration</text></text>
  <text>flag = <text style="color:blue"><b>true</b></text>; <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//assignment</text></text>
  <text>boolean testResult = <text style="color:blue"><b>false</b></text>; <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//both declaration and assignment</text></text></code>
  <p> Since relational operators evaluate to a boolean value, you can store the result of a comparison in a variable:</p>
  <code><text><text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> positiveFlag =  (x > 0); <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//true if x is positive</text></text>
  <text><text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> negativeFlag =  (x < 0); <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//true if x is negative</text></text>
  <text><text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> zeroFlag =  (x == 0); <text style="color: lightskyblue; font-size:20px">//true if x is zero</text></text></code>
  <p>The parentheses are unnecessary, but they make the code easier to read. 
    A variable defined in this way is called a <b>flag</b>, because it signals or “flags” the presence or absence of a condition.</p>
  <p>You can use flag variables as part of a conditional statement later:</p>
  <code><text>if (positiveFlag){</text>
  <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is positive");</text>
  <text>}</text></code>
  <p>Notice that you don’t have to write if (evenFlag == <text style="color:blue"><b>true</b></text>). Since evenFlag
    is a <text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text>, it’s already a condition. Likewise, to check if a flag is <text style="color:blue"><b>false</b></text>:</p>
  <code><text>if (!positiveFlag){</text>
  <text style="margin-left: 40px">System.out.println("x is NOT positive");</text>
  <text>}</text></code>

  <article>
  <p>In our previous examples, we prompt the user to enter an int (whole number) that we will evaluate using our if/else block.</p> 
  <p>We use <b>.nextInt()</b>, so the Scanner is <b>expecting to read data that is compatible with an int</b>. <br><br>If the user enters a whole number, the Scanner accepts it and 
    converts it to a int. <br><br><b>But if the user types anything else, i.e a floating-point number, the Scanner throws

    <p>We can prevent this error by checking the input before parsing it. 
      <br><br>The Scanner class has <text style="color:blue"><b>boolean</b></text> methods that can validate whether the input is of a particular type, in our case we can use

  <br />
  <header><b>Switch Statements</b></header>
  <article>
  <p>Instead of writing many if/else statements, we can use the switch statement. 
    <br><br>The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:</p>  
    <img style="width: 45%; height: 45%; display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;" src="https://github.com/amaraauguste/amaraauguste.github.io/blob/master/courses/CISC1115/images/switchstatement.png?raw=true" alt="switch statement"/>
    <p>This is how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>switch expression is evaluated once</b>.</li>
      <li>The <b>value of the expression</b> is <b>compared with the values of each case</b>.</li>
      <li>If there is a <b>match</b>, the <b>associated block of code is executed</b>.</li>
      <li>The <b>break</b> and <b>default</b> keywords are optional, but extremely useful. We'll talk about this in a bit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's try an example that <b>reads in a number and uses it to calculate the day of the week</b>:</p>

    <code><text>Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);</text>
    <text>System.out.print("Enter a number (1-7): ");</text>
    <text>int day = sc.nextInt();</text></code>

    <p>Now, let's write some code that will represent the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Monday</li>
      <li>Tuesday</li>
      <li>Wednesday</li>
      <li>Thursday</li>
      <li>Friday</li>
      <li>Saturday</li>
      <li>Sunday</li>
    </ol>

  </article>
  <br />
  <header>The break Keyword</header>
  <article>
  <p>When Java reaches a <b>break</b> keyword, it <b>breaks out of the switch block</b>.
    This will <b>stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block</b>.
    When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. <b>There is no need for more testing</b>.</p>  
   <p>A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.</p>

  </article>
  <br />
  <header>The default Keyword</header>
  <article>
  <p>The <b>default</b> keyword specifies some code to run if there is <b>no case match</b>.</p>  
   <p>Note that if the default statement is <b>used as the last statement in a switch block, it does not need a break</b>.</p>
    <br>
   <p>How can we modify our <a href="/courses/CISC1115/classwork_code/

  <p>Alternatively, we can use ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:</p>

  <header>Reading in chars</header>
  <article>
  <p>Unfortunately the Scanner class does not have a specific method used to read in char values the same we we can ints (.nextInt()), doubles (.nextDouble()), etc.</p>  
   <p>However, since we CAN read in Strings and Strings are made up of character values, there is a way around this:</p>
   <code><text>char choice = sc.next().charAt(0);</text></code>

   <p>The <b>.charAt()</b> method <b></b>returns the character at the specified index in a String</b> and the <b>index of the first character is 0</b> (we will talk more about the other characters when we talk more about Strings and their methods)</p>
   <p>Doing this is a loophole to read in char values from the keyboard.</p>
