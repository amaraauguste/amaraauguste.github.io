REVIEW

a)

public class TemperatureConverter {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        double f = 255.5;

        // Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
        double c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9;

        // Print temperature in Celsius 
        System.out.println(f + " degree(s) Fahrenheit is equal to " + c + " degree(s) Celsius.");
    }
}

b) -9 4 2.00

c) This is a perfectly legal statement because the class name Math allows Java to distinguish between the variable sqrt and the method sqrt. 
However, we should avoid having multiple aspects of a program with the same name as it may cause confusion.

d) (Math.pow(x, 2) - (1 / (y + 3))) / ((1 / z) + Math.sqrt(x))
