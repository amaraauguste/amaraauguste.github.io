b) If there is a variable x and a variable sqrt that was declared as a double before this line occurs then YES, this is a perfectly legal statement because the class name Math allows Java to distinguish between the variable sqrt and the method sqrt. However, we should avoid having multiple aspects of a program with the same name as it may cause confusion.


c)

public class RandomNumbers {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int min = 1;
        int max = 11;
        int rand = (int) (Math.random() * (max - min) + min);//Generate random number
        System.out.println("Random Number: " + rand);//different each run
    }
}


d) Converting from double to int may cause a loss of precision, so you must explicitly apply the cast. However, converting from int to double will never lead to a loss of precision so Java automatically performs the conversion.

        System.out.print("Enter the ending city: ");
        city2 = in.next();
        System.out.print("Enter distance in miles between cities: ");
        distance = in.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the cost of travel per mile: ");
        costPerMile = in.nextDouble();
        dollarAmount = (int) (distance * costPerMile);
        System.out.println("\n\nThe cost of traveling from "
                + city1 + " to " + city2 + " is $" + dollarAmount);

        int totalSecs = sc.nextInt();

        int hours = totalSecs / 3600;
        int minutes = (totalSecs % 3600) / 60;
        int seconds = totalSecs % 60;
